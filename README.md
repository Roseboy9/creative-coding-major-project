# User Instructions

My variation of our team’s group artwork offers diverse user experiences through a series of interactive and autonomous modes. You can switch between these states using specific keyboard inputs:

- **Initial State (Zoom Mode – Default):**
    - **How it works:** When the artwork first loads, it defaults to _Zoom Mode_. In this mode, the central artwork (the dove and olive branch) responds to the vertical position of your mouse. 
    - **Interaction:** Move your mouse vertically (Y-axis) across the screen. The dove and olive branch will smoothly scale in or out depending on how close your mouse is to the vertical centre of the canvas. Moving the mouse closer to the centre zooms out, while moving it towards the top or bottom edges zooms in.
- **‘M’ Key (Toggle Float Mode):** 
    - **How it works:** Press the ‘M’ key (either uppercase or lowercase) to cycle between the available modes. If you are in _Zoom Mode_, pressing ‘M’ switches you to _Float Mode_. If you are in _Float Mode_ or _Pixelate_ & _Glitch Mode_, pressing ‘M’ returns you to _Zoom Mode_. 
    - **Interaction:** In _Float Mode_, the dove and olive branch become autonomous, continuously floating horizontally from left to right across the screen. When they move completely off the right edge, they seamlessly reappear from the far left, creating an endless loop. They also exhibit a natural, organic bobbing motion.
- **‘P’ Key (Toggle Pixelate & Glitch Effect):** 
    - **How it works:** This mode is an extension of _Float Mode_. You must first be in _Float Mode_ (by pressing ‘M’) to activate this effect. Press the ‘P’ key (or ‘p’) to toggle the _Pixelate_ & _Glitch_ visual effect on or off. 
    - **Interaction:** The dove and olive branch continue their autonomous horizontal floating and organic bobbing motion, as in _Float Mode_, but with an added split-screen visual transformation. When they are in the left half of the screen, they retain their normal, smooth appearance. However, once any part crosses the horizontal centre into the right half, that portion becomes pixelated and exhibits a subtle, randomised glitch effect. The background dots and overall canvas background remain smooth and unaffected, ensuring the visual transformation is focused solely on the main subject.

These three states are adapted from class exercises in Week 7 _(Object-Oriented Programming)_ and Week 10 _(Easing & Transformation)_.
